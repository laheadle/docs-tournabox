		<section id="getting-started" title="Getting Started">

		  Imagine a small tournament called the "utopian open." You need three HTML elements to display it as a tournabox.

		  <subsection id="the-container" title="Element 1: The Container">
			<p>This is the element your readers will see, containing the tournament results. It looks like this:</p>

			<hcode lang="xml" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="data/utopian-open-container.html"/></hcode>
			<p> The container <emph>must</emph> have class
			  <ic>tournabox-container.</ic></p> The id is used to find the entry and outcome elements (see below).
		  </subsection>

		  <subsection id="the-entries" title="Element 2: The Entries">
			<p>This element contains the names of all the entries (players
			  or teams) in the tournament. Entries are listed in order: the
			  first entry plays the second entry, the third entry plays the
			  fourth entry, etc. In the second round, the winner of the match
			  between #1 and #2 will play the winner of the match between #3
			  and #4, etc.</p>

			<hcode lang="xml" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="data/utopian-open-entries.html"/></hcode>
			<p> An entry looks like this: </p>
			
			<P><ic>NAME OPTIONAL-COUNTRY [OPTIONAL-SEED] (OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE)</ic></P>
			<p> Where the optional country is a three letter country code,
			  the optional seed is a number, and the optional attribute is a
			  letter, such as 'w' for "withdrew" or 'q' for "qualifier." </p>
			
			<p> The entries are found by starting from the id of the container,
			  here <ic>"utopian-open,"</ic> and adding the string <ic>"-entries."</ic> Thus, by giving the entries element the id
			  <ic>"utopian-open-entries,"</ic> you tell tournabox which
			  element contains the entries for the container <ic>"utopian-open."</ic> </p>

			<p> You <emph>should</emph> hide this element by using <ic>style="display: none"</ic> as in the example above.</p>
		  </subsection>

		  <subsection id="the-outcomes" title="Element 3: The Outcomes">
			<p>This element contains the record of wins and losses. Each
			  line lists the name of a winner.</p>
			<p> The name can be abbreviated
			  to save typing, as long as there is only one name matching the
			  abbreviation. Abbreviations can come from anywhere in the
			  name, and case does not matter. For example, to abbreviate
			  "Joe Smith" you could enter "joe" or "smith".</p>

			<p> Note that Sam Querrey (abbreviated 'qu') is listed
			twice. This means that he won in the first round, <emph>
			and then won again </emph> in the second round.</p>

			<hcode lang="xml" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="data/utopian-open-outcomes.html"/></hcode>
			<p> The outcomes are found by starting from the id of the container,
			  here <ic>"utopian-open,"</ic> and adding the string <ic>"-outcomes".</ic> Thus, by
			  giving the outcomes element the id <ic>"utopian-open-outcomes,"</ic> you tell
			  tournabox which element contains the outcomes for the container
			  "utopian-open." </p>

			<include file="data/utopian-open-container.html"/>
			<include file="data/utopian-open-entries.html"/>
			<include file="data/utopian-open-outcomes.html"/>

		<section id="setting-groups-and-filters" title="Setting Groups and Filters">
		  <p>Sometimes, you want to show the checkboxes -- the ways of
		  grouping a tournabox -- in a different order. Other times,
		  you don't want to show as many ways of grouping a
		  tournabox. You can do either by adding the
		  attribute <ic>tournabox-groups</ic> to your container
		  element.</p> This attribute's content is the name and order
		  of the grouping checkboxes you want to show.

		  <p> You can also set the initial filter string using the
		  attribute <ic>tournabox-filters</ic>.To give more than one
		  filter string, separate each filter string by a comma, as
		  in <ic>term 1,term2</ic>. Matches will be shown if they
		  match any of the strings.</p>

		  <p> Here's an example which only shows the "by country" and
			"By seed", in that order, with an initial filter showing
			Russian and Serbian players.
		  </p>
