	  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

	  Imagine a small tournament called the "utopian open." You need three HTML elements to display it as a tournabox.

	  <h3>Element 1: The Container</h3>
	  <p>This is the element your readers will see, containing the tournament results. It looks like this:</p>

	  <hcode lang="xml" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="data/utopian-open-container.html"/></hcode>
	  <p> The container <emph>must</emph> have class
	  <ic>tourney-container.</ic></p> The id is used to find the entry and outcome elements (see below).

	  <h3>Element 2: The Entries</h3>
	  <p>This element contains the names of all the entries (players
	  or teams) in the tournament. Entries are listed in order: the
	  first entry plays the second entry, the third entry plays the
	  fourth entry, etc. In the second round, the winner of the match
	  between #1 and #2 will play the winner of the match between #3
	  and #4, etc.</p>

	  <hcode lang="xml" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="data/utopian-open-entries.html"/></hcode>
	  <p> An entry looks like this: </p>
	  
	  <P>NAME OPTIONAL-COUNTRY [OPTIONAL-SEED] (OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE)</P>
	  <p> Where the optional country is a three letter country code,
	  the optional seed is a number, and the optional attribute is a
	  letter, such as 'w' for "withdrew" or 'q' for "qualifier." </p>
	  
	  <p> The entries are found by starting from the id of the container,
		namely <ic>"utopian-open,"</ic> and adding the string <ic>"-entries."</ic> Thus, by giving the entries element the id
		<ic>"utopian-open-entries,"</ic> you tell tournabox that this
		element contains the entries for the container <ic>"utopian-open."</ic> </p>

	  <p> You <emph>should</emph> hide this element by using <ic>style="display: none"</ic> as in the example above.</p>

	  <h3>Element 3: The Outcomes</h3>
	  <hcode lang="xml" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="data/utopian-open-outcomes.html"/></hcode>
	  <p> The outcomes are found by starting from the id of the container,
		namely "utopian-open," and adding the string "-outcomes." Thus, by
		giving the outcomes element the id "utopian-open-outcomes," you tell
		tournabox that this element contains the outcomes for the container
		"utopian-open." </p>
